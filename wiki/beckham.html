		<h3 style="color:#ff10f0">my thoughts on the device</h3>
		<p>The moto z3 play has been a very consistent device over the last few years, a joy to use, and supported by lineageOS, which is a requirement for me when looking for devices I might want to purchase.</p>
		<p>The Moto z3 play has very solid hardware, a taller device that is almost in "phablet" territory. A mostly edge-to-edge display, which I'm a big fan of, and something new to me when I first got the phone: a side-mounted fingerprint scanner, which I actually have grown to prefer.</p>
		<p>The camera on this phone is quite good, definitely better than my other main device, my <a h ref="mata.html">Essential PH-1</a>. I notice this camera's weaknesses more when taking shots of things further away. However, for closer-up shots, this camera performs fairly well.I have taken some pretty good nature shots with it while out on walks that I think look pretty good.</p>
		<p>The battery on the device is very solid. Keep in mind I am running LineageOS with no Google services, and that I barely use my phone, but it is able to get over 2 days before it needs to go on the charger again.</p>
		<p>Also, one thing that I love about Moto phones, which is pretty minor in most respects, is this one singular thing - the ability to "chop" the phone twice in the air to turn the flashlight off and on. It's such a small thing, but I find myself trying to do it with other devices from several years of muscle memory from using this and other Moto devices.</p>
		<p>There are "Moto Mods" for this and other Moto Z devices which augment the phone in some way, like adding a battery case to it, turning it into a game controller, making it into a big pair of speakers, etc. These Mods connect to the devices on the back by way of magnetic ports. I have not tested any of these Mods out, nor do any of them interest me in particular (aside from maybe the battery case - who doesn't love more juice?).</p>

		<p style="font-size:12px;color:#ff10f0"><b>we did a short installation of lineageOS on beckham for a recording.</b></p>
		<p>The Moto z3 play is a very solid device, and while it has stopped getting updates from Motorola for quite awhile now, it is still being kept alive and well by LineageOS. I plan on keeping this device around and using it until either it stops being supported or something happens to it.</p>
