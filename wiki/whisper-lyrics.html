This is the dead land
This is cactus land
Here, the stone images are raised
Here, they receive the supplication of a dead man's hand
Under the twinkle of a fading star

This is how the world ends
Not with a bang, but with a whisper
And it goes a little something like this

Is it like this in death's other kingdom?
Walking alone, in the hour when we are trembling with tenderness
Lips that would kiss, form prayers to broken stone

This is how the world ends
Not with a bang, but with a whisper
And it goes a little something like this

Behaving as the wind behaves
No nearer
Not that final meeting
In the twilight kingdom

This is the dead land
This is cactus land
Here, the stone images are raised
Here, they receive the supplication of a dead man's hand
Under the twinkle of a fading star
