		<p><i>experimental project started in 2017</i></p>
        <p><b>x3nyth</b> is a project I started in 2017 after the split of another project. I was getting a little tired at the time of doing the more traditional "EDM" style, and I wanted to move in a more experimental direction.</p>
		<p>The x3nyth project came from this idea, and I began making some experimental stuff using <a href="https://warmplace.ru/soft/sunvox/">Sunvox</a> as my music software of choice (still using it!). I have slowly been shaping the resulting material into what will be the first real x3nyth album. One of the things I enjoy doing the most is generative-style music and ambient.</p>
		<p>x3nyth is writing the original soundtrack for <a href="DarkNightsRising.html">Dark Nights Rising</a>, as well, a game put together by <a href="ravens-ridge.html">Raven's Ridge</a>.</p>
		<blockquote><b style="color:#39ff14;font-size:25px">~</b> Note that you can now listen to x3nyth songs on the <a href="../tunes.html">tunes</a> page!</blockquote>
		<h4 style="color:#FF10F0">discography</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><i>autosynchronicity</i> - 2024</li>
			<li><i>Dark Nights Rising</i> - TBA</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For the last few years, I've been writing that first record, called <i>autosynchronicity</i>. It's mostly been making a bunch of music, sorting through it and finding things that I think fit the particular theme well. I look forward to having it assembled into a full record.</p>
		<h4 style="color:#FF10F0">notes</h4>
		<p>x3nyth has never played a live show, but I wouldn't mind changing that sometime with some live-editing or generative sets. I also like the idea of manipulating Sunvox through <a href="https://100r.co/site/orca">Orca</a>, which I am going to be experimenting with further soon.</p>
		<p>I have also thought about streaming live music sets online (twitch/youtube) for the x3nyth project. This is something I might try to make a regular thing on my channels.</p> 
		<p>The main goal of x3nyth is always to write more experimental music, things that make me think of stuff like Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada, and some other acts I grew up with that were outside of the mainstream. The x3nyth project so far has yielded some interesting "industrial" sounding tracks, some ambient stuff, generative music, and some freeform-melodic stuff that was put together live.</p>
		<p>I intend to keep exploring that side of my musical influences, so I see myself making things under the x3nyth name for quite awhile to come.</p>
