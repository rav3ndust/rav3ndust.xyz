		<p><i>a place for our code, built on top of gitea</i></p>
		<p><b>xvoidsx</b> (<i>pronounced <b>voids</b>, the <b>x</b>'s are silent</i>) is the name of our git forge. It is based on <a href="https://about.gitea.com/">Gitea</a>, a free and open source git forge web application. I used to run a Gitea instance for the old web company I used to work at, and I have missed having one of my own.</p>
		<p>While I like Codeberg and GitHub, the two code forges I use the most, I also value having a space of my own for these things. You never know when any online platform could have an outage, or some kind of problem that prevents you from being able to get into your stuff when you need to.</p>
		<p>xvoidsx is based on a vanilla version of Gitea, with some modifications made to the styling to make it our own. I like the functionality of Gitea and how it works, and how lightweight it is. It has everything I need to get work done and to collaborate with others on code.</p>
		<p>xvoidsx is mainly used by myself and my small team of collaborators, but others will be welcome to join and host their own code by invitation. I will have an invitation link setup when the setup is finished, so that anyone can apply. Our only requirement will be that everyone who participates on xvoidsx only hosts free software projects - wanting to keep your stuff closed is fine and there are plenty of platforms for it, but we don't want to use our server space for hosting proprietary software.</p>
		<p>Depending on how many people want to use it and how well it scales up with testing multiple outside users, I might make it open registration in the future. We'll see how it goes!</p>
        <blockquote>Just so you know, <b>xvoidsx</b> existing isn't going to stop our projects still continuing on GitHub and Codeberg. All changes will be mirrored between each repo, as they are now between my GitHub and Codeberg repositories. This makes it easy for potential contributors to our projects to contribute no matter which platform they feel the most comfortable using.</blockquote>
