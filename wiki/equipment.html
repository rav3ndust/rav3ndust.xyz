		<p><i>audio gear I've known and loved</i></p>
		<p>Audio hardware is a lot of fun to collect and use. I have owned, played with, and sold a good bit of audio hardware, including things like mixers, synthesizers, guitars, drums, and more, so I will have to separate the sections of things I currently own and things I used to own. I will probably also spotlight some things I haven't necessarily owned, but things I used, that stuck out to me.</p>
		<p>When it comes to making music, my main focus is on experimental and atmospheric music, usually focused around instrumentals, so most of my musical collection revolves around the flow of digital composition and production, and doing some live recordings with instruments such as guitars or synths.</p>

		<h3 style="color:#ff10f0">gear I currently own</h3>
		<p>Here is a small list of the audio gear I currently have. I might miss a few of the smaller things, and if I do, I will be sure to add it back here when I finally realize it. :-)</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b style="color:#ff10f0">Yamaha MG124cx</b> - This mixer is my newest addition to the studio, and to this page. It was given to me in the beginning of 2025 by a great new friend I made recently who lives locally. We've been doing some musical projects together lately, and it's been fun. He didn't use this mixer anymore, so he gave it to me, and I've been getting used to it. It has 12 channels, and is almost exactly like the Yamaha mixer I used to have, but with some additional channels. It doesn't have anything fancy like USB connections or fancy lights, but it's a solid mixer that gets the job done.</li>
			<li><b style="color:#ff10f0">Dean EVO XM electric guitar</b> - This is probably my favorite guitar at the moment. I bought this one from my best friend back in 2020 (I think), and it has played exceptionally well. It has great action, stays in tune well, sounds mean when distorted, and warm and bluesy when needed.</li>
            		<li><b style="color:#ff10f0">Johnson Strat copy electric guitar</b> - This guitar was my first ever electric, and the original guitar I still have from my childhood (my other original guitar was an acoustic, but it was stolen a few years ago). This guitar was a gift from my dad.</li>
            		<li><b style="color:#ff10f0">Fender acoustic guitar</b> - I got this guitar in a trade with my brother not long after someone I used to consider a friend stole my other acoustic guitar. I love having an acoustic to take around with me and play, so I made sure to get another one.</li>
            		<li><b style="color:#ff10f0">Road King antique acoustic guitar</b> - I bought this guitar at an auction in 2021 and don't know much about it yet, other than that it was made in the 50s. It plays decently, though the action was atrocious at first - this could be down to the person who owned it before, and not the brand, however.</li>
            		<li><b style="color:#ff10f0">Hondo "Spare Parter" electric guitar</b> - This is another one that I'm not too sure about, other than it plays well. I got this guitar in pieces in 2009 or so from a friend from school, and put it together and wired the instrument. After stringing it up, it played well, and continues to play well to this day.</li>
			<li><b style="color:#ff10f0">Leolani Hawaii ukulele</b> - This is a cool little ukulele my wife and I found in the local flea market. We use Martin ukulele strings on it, and it sounds warm and delightful. It is very fun to play, and the sound of a ukulele is infectious!</li>
            		<li><b style="color:#ff10f0">Marshall amp</b> - Marshall amps sound good, I've never played out of one that I did't think sounded great. The Marshall amp I have isn't a big one, it is actually quite small for the size of the sound it can put out, but it is a good little amp that is easy to take places and easy to get great sounds out of.</li>
            		<li><b style="color:#ff10f0">Digitech rp50 effects pedal</b> - I have had a few different variations on this pedal, but this is the one I am using right now. I used to have its bigger brother, the rp100, which had some more features, but this one is very good for the amount of well-made presets are included, as well as the built-in "drum machine" for selecting rhythms in different styles. It's quite easy to build your own sounds, as well, and save them into the soundbank.</li>
            		<li><b style="color:#ff10f0">Korg Kaossilator Pro</b> - This thing has been one of my favorite pieces of kit I've ever owned, ever since I first got it. I bought this off the owner of a venue i used to play at (Steamwerks Hookah Lounge in Tulsa, OK). It has a synthesizer, drum pads, the ability to create loops, and more built right in, and it's easy to create and edit sounds, record loops over each other, and keep rhythms. I love this thing and definitely recommend anyone to add it to their repertoire.</li>
			<li><b style="color:#ff10f0">Casio synthesizer</b> - This is an old '80s synthesizer. It's nothing fancy, has a few built-in sound presets, some drum patterns, and you can record loops.</li>
			<li><b style="color:#ff10f0">Behringer Xenyx 802S mixer</b> - The Xenyx 802S isn't a fancy mixer, but it is more than enough to get the job done. I have had fancier mixers in the past, and other than giving me some more inputs which I no longer need these days, they didn't do much more than the Xenyx can, for less of the price. This one has 8 inputs, and its smaller size saves ample table-space for other gear.</li>
			<li><b style="color:#ff10f0">Behringer USB interface</b> - I use this to make my effects pedal talk to my computer. This is handy for doing things like recording guitars or synthesizers directly into Sunvox or Audacity.</li>

		<h3 style="color:#ff10f0">gear I've owned in the past</h3>
		<p>I have owned a good bit of gear through my musical journey, in different states all through my life. Here are some of the highlights of the pieces of kit that I miss the most:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b style="color:#ff10f0">microKorg</b> - The microKorg was an awesome synthesizer during the time that I had it. I sadly sold it in order to help facilitate my move out-of-state, and still plan on replacing it with another just like it. The one I had was black and red, and had a microphone built in for using the vocoding functionality. I used to use this instrument in conjunction with my Kaoss pad during live shows and in some recordings.</li>
            		<li><b style="color:#ff10f0">Ibanez acoustic guitar</b> - I used to have this really pretty, blue Ibanez acoustic guitar. It had a built-in tuner and played amazingly. I bought it from Guitar Center in Tulsa, OK in 2016, and it was sadly one of two instruments stolen by someone I used to think was a friend in 2023. I replaced it with a Fender acoustic, but wouldn't mind having another Ibanez acoustic of the same model again sometime, should I find one again.</li>
			<li><b style="color:#ff10f0">Overload acoustic guitar</b> - I don't have a ton of information on this guitar, but it was the first one I ever owned. My family bought it for me when I was 8 or 9 years old from my school's music teacher, and while it was a no-name brand, it was still a fairly well-playing guitar. It was one of two instruments stolen from me by someone I used to consider a friend.</li>
			<li><b style="color:#ff10f0">Yamaha MG10 mixer</b> - This was a great mixer, and is another piece of kit I sadly sold in order to help facilitate my move out-of-state. I used this mixer in old production work, used it to adjust audio levels live during shows, and also used it do some experimental <a href="https://waveinformer.com/2024/02/17/no-input-mixing/">no-input mixing</a> productions, which no longer exist today.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>This page was a good breakdown of the hardware I use when it comes to my audio endeavours. If you want to see a good breakdown of the software I use when it comes to production, be sure to check out the <a href="production.html">production</a> page.</p>
        <p>I'll also probably update this page with some pictures over time so you can see my collection. If you want to show me some of your favorite audio gear of your own, please feel free to <a href="../contact.html">contact me</a> and tell me all about it!</p>
