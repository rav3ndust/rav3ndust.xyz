		<h2 style="color:#FF10F0">granny's breakfast</h2>
		<p><i>a wonderful breakfast, just like granny used to make it</i></p>
		<p>When I was a kid, one of my favorite places to go was my grandma's house (we called her Granny). We'd hang out, do stuff in the yard, watch movies, play games, and hit the town. And every morning that I was there, we would have a great breakfast of pancakes made from scratch, bacon, and sausages.</p>
		<p>My grandma never kept her own cookbook, and instead stored all of her recipes in her head, so I've done my best to "reverse-engineer" a few of them. I will never be able to approximate it exactly, but I have been able to get as close as I think I can to "Granny's Breakfast". We make this at home quite frequently, and it makes for a delicious start to the day (or you can have breakfast for dinner, which is a delicious end to the day!).</p>

		<h3 style="color:#ff10f0">ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
			<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
			<li>1 cup milk</li>
			<li>1 large egg</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons melted butter (and some extra for cooking)</li>
			<li>Optional: vanilla extract, for added flavor.</li>
			<li>6-8 slices of bacon</li>
			<li>4 breakfast sausages (links or patties, your choice)</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="breakHelper">

		</div>
		<h3 style="color:#ff10f0">cooking instructions</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>In a skillet, cook your bacon over medium heat until crispy, flipping it occasionally. Once it's cooked, transfer your bacon slices to a plate lined with paper-towels to drain any excess grease, and to protect them until you're ready to come back to them.</li>
			<li>In the same skillet, and using some of the same bacon grease for flavor, add in your breakfast sausages. Cook for about 6-8 minutes or according to the instructions on the package. Turn them occasionally until they are browned and cooked through. Transfer them to a plate when done, and keep them warm.</li>
			<li>Time to start your pancakes. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
			<li>In another bowl, combine your milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract (if you're using it). Whisk this mixture until it is well-combined.</li>
			<li>Now, pour the wet pancake ingredients into the dry ones, and stir until they are well-combined. Be careful not to overmix them - a few lumps are alright.</li>
			<li>Heat up a non-stick skillet or griddle to medium heat, and add a bit of butter to coat the surface.</li>
			<li>Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake you want to make. Cook them until bubbles form on the surface and the edges begin to look set, normally 2-3 minutes. Flip it, and cook for another few minutes until it is golden brown. Repeat with however much batter you plan to use, adding butter to the skillet surface as needed.</li>
			<li>When finished, serve the pancakes, bacon, and sausages together on a plate with some maple syrup if desired. Enjoy!</li>

		<p>They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and there is nothing like having a breakfast that is delicious and perks you right up, ready to take on your day. While I will never be able to make this breakfast as perfect as my grandma used to, I still love making it in her honor, and it is still quite tasty! :)</p>
