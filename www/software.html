        <p>I use all kinds of open-source software, and I write a good deal of my own as well. Some of my scripts are mostly just personal things that I might not ever share because most people might find them useless or mundane, but I like to share what I see as my more useful scripts.</p>
        <p>I'll link my GitHub below, highlight some of my favorite projects that I've written, and other software projects that I admire.</p>

<h1>Other Stuff I Love</h1>
<p>Here is some other open source software that I use regularly.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>LibreOffice:</b> I manage an online writing service, and have almost exclusively used LibreOffice for writing work, spreadsheets, and other office related tasks for several years now. I highly recommend the LibreOffice Suite for a fantastic free and open source office solutions. They also respect Microsoft Office extensions like <b>.docx</b> and <b>.xls</b>, so your LibreOffice will play nicely when your colleague sends you a document written using Word.</li>
        <li><b>The Tor Project:</b> This day and age, our online anonymity is sacrosanct. The Tor Browser and its related software helps you anonymize yourself online by essentially bouncing your connection through a series of "nodes" distributed across the globe.</li>
        <li><b>GNU nano:</b> Only Jesus Christ himself knows how much I use <b>nano</b>. It is my favorite text editor on the planet, I can use it easily from my terminal. 100% of this website has been written using nano.</li>
        <li><b>Linux Mint:</b> For years now, Linux Mint continues to be my Linux OS of choice, and I have used so many of them. From Arch, to Ubuntu, to CentOS, and more, and I always come back home to Mint. If you love a Debian based, stable, secure OS that respects your privacy (and does away with Ubuntu's snap nonsense by default), you should check out Mint.</li>
        <li><b>PureOS:</b> I am using my Pinephone as my daily driver for the most part these days, and the PureOS fork by mozzwald remains my preferred mobile Linux distribution. It is based off of the code for Purism's PureOS for the Librem 5, so privacy considerations and access to a full Debian based OS is available at your fingertips right after installation.</li>
        <li><b>Brave Browser:</b> I know I'm supposed to shill Firefox when promoting free and open-source software, but the truth is, these days, Brave is the best browser out there for me. It is less bloated, comes with the privacy settings I like (including blocking ads) by default, and was created by one of the founders of Mozilla. Being based on Chromium, it is also compatible with Chrome extensions.</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Remember, if you love a certain free and open-source application, operating system, or whatever else, make sure you donate to their developers! Contributions are what help developers of free software know that their efforts are appreciated, and helps fund that software's continued development.</h3>

  <h3>Check out some of the stuff I'm building!</h3>
    <p>I'm usually always writing <a href="software.html">some new software</a>. Lately, I've been working on a new webapp and some bash scripts. All my stuff is free and open-source on my GitHub, so feel free to <i>git clone</i> my stuff and try it out, modify it, and do whatever you'd like with it.</p>
    <p font-size="28px">If you like what I'm doing, think about <a href="contribute.html">helping me buy a pizza</a> so I'm nice and full enough to keep writing software.</p>
