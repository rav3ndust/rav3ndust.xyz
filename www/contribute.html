<p style="color:black">If you think I'm doing a good job on stuff and want to throw me a little cryptocurrency or a bit of USD or something, that is really nice 
of you and always appreciated. I should note that anything I make on this site will be put towards this site, as well as my other projects, to help them grow into
something that I think people <i>might</i> enjoy. This could possibly include some GNU/Linux related videos, text walkthroughs, and other helpful things that I can
think of.</p>
<p style="color:black"><b>What if I Don't Have Money</b></p>
<p style="color:black">You don't need to worry about contributing financially if you don't want to or don't have the extra funds. Consider contributing some time to 
some of <a href="https://github.com/rav3ndust">my free software projects on my Github</a> or volunteer some time to helping other free software developers continue
to make their projects amazing.</p>
<p style="color:black">There are lots of ways you can contribute, too! You don't need to be a web designer or a programmer to be able to help out the free software
community. You can help write great documentation for your favorite projects, help out with translating them into other languages, or even just spreading the word to
others about your favorite free software projects. These are all great and helpful ways you can aid other users as well as the developers in making free software
projects even better.</p>
<h3 style="color:black" align="left">How you can contribute to me</h3>
<p style="color:black">Thanks for helping out! You can contribute in a number of ways. Please note that the empty spots are areas I will be updating as soon as I 
can.</p>

        <h3>Check out some of the stuff I'm building!</h3>
        <p>I'm usually always writing <a href="software.html">some new software</a>. Lately, I've been working on a new webapp and some bash scripts. All my stuff
        is free and open-source on my GitHub, so feel free to <i>git clone</i> my stuff and try it out, modify it, and do whatever you'd like with it.</p>
        <p>If you like what I'm doing, think about <a href="contribute.html">helping me buy a pizza</a> so I'm nice and full enough to keep writing software.</p>
