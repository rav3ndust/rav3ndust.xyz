<p style="color:black"><b>GNU/Linux operating systems.</b></p>
<p style="color:black">For people who care about their technological freedom, privacy, and having complete control over their computing, there is no better operating system to choose
than a GNU/Linux distribution (except maybe BSD). When you choose to run a GNU/Linux distribution instead of one of the operating systems that hold power over their
users and force them to use non-free, closed-source software, you reclaim part of your digital freedom, and there is no better feeling than this.</p>
<p style="color:black">Of course, a big part of the appeal of free and open-source operating systems and software applications is the fact that we can take the source code, <i>change
it</i> if we'd like, and use it however we want to. We are then free to send our changes back to the maintainer of the project, and if they like the changes, the code
could become a permanent part of the project.</p>
<h3 style="color:black">Free software is great for community.</h3>
<p style="color:black">When you use free software, you know that there have been thousands of other eyes on the code, modifying it, and auditing its security. These same community members
make their own changes and contributions to software projects, and entire communities can form. Many huge projects have been formed from small and simple ideas. The
Linux kernel itself is a great example of the community that can form behind this ethos. Linus Torvalds wrote the Linux kernel, and then it was picked up and used in
projects ranging from the GNU operating system and Android, as well as powering the biggest majority of webservers in the world. If you are an internet user, you have
definitely interacted with a Linux server at some point, probably without even realizing it.</p>
<h3 style="color:black">What Linux distributions I like.</h3>
<p style="color:black">I am an unashamed distro-hopper, and am always messing around with different operating systems, usually in virtual machines these days. Here are my thoughts on 
some GNU/Linux distributions that I use frequently, and that I have used in the past.</p>

	<ul>
	<li><b>Linux Mint.</b> Linux Mint is still my go-to distro almost every time, so many years after getting into GNU/Linux so mamny years ago. Linux Mint is
	stable, it is friendly, and it is ready to get to work out of the box. You can find it in three official flavors for desktop environments, including Xfce,
	Cinnamon (Mint's homespun DE), and MATE. I am currently running Linux Mint 20 on my main workstation.</li>
	<li><b>Manjaro.</b> Manjaro is a great distribution that is based on Arch Linux, making it a rolling release. This means all of your packages will always 
	be up to date. Manjaro is also one of the best distributions for folks who want access to a functioning system immediately after install. Since this is 
	Arch-based, you also have access to the Arch User Repository (AUR), granting you access to thousands of extra packages you won't be able to find easily on
	some distros.</li>
	<li><b>Arch Linux.</b> I do love customizing, and there is no better playground for customization and tinkering than there is with Arch Linux. For a complete
	newbie, it can seem frustrating to install since you have to do everything yourself, but these days there are countless tutorials online and even scripts
	that you can run to help you set up a functioning Arch install in a matter of time. For learning all the ins and outs of Linux and really becoming a *power
	user*, you will find no better training than by learning and customizing Arch.</li>
	<li><b>Debian.</b> Debian is one of the oldest Linux distros out there, and is one of the options frequently used for servers. In fact, this very website
	is hosted by my Debian webserver. Debian is loved for being stable and rock solid, and this is one of the reasons why I frequently use Debian and some of
	its derivatives for my go-to work solutions.</li>
	</ul>

<h3 style="color:black">Notes on Ubuntu.</h3>
<p style="color:black">I still <i>love</i> Ubuntu. In most of its "flavors" (that I've tried). It was my introduction into the world of GNU/Linux back in 2012, after 
 all. Ubuntu is backed by <b>Canonical</b>, the company that has worked on the flagship distribution for years. The various "flavors" of Ubuntu are all the same OS 
 with different desktop environments.</p>
<h3 style="color:black">The various Ubuntu flavors.</h3>
<p>Here are some of the official Ubuntu flavors that you can try out to see how you like it.</p>

        <ul>
        <li><b>Ubuntu</b> - the flagship version of Ubuntu. Uses the <b>GNOME</b> desktop environment, and used to use Canonical's homespun <i>Unity</i> desktop.</li>
        <li><b>Kubuntu</b> - this flavor of Ubuntu uses the gorgeous <b>KDE Plasma</b> desktop environment.</li>
        <li><b>Xubuntu</b> - this flavor of Ubuntu uses the lightweight <b>XFCE</b> desktop environment.</li>
        <li><b>Lubuntu</b> - this flavor of Ubuntu uses the <b>LxQt</b> desktop environment.</li>
        </ul>

<p>You can find out more about the different flavors of Ubuntu at <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/flavours">this link</a> from the official Ubuntu website.</p>
<p style="color:black">Being one of the most popular GNU/Linux distributions, Ubuntu or one of its derivatives are usually the entry point for newbies to the world 
 of GNU/Linux when they come over from Windows or MacOS, so having all of these different styles to choose from helps the user ease into their newfound computing 
 freedom.</p>
<h4 style="color:black">A little on Snap.</h4>
<p style="color:black">Recently, with <b>Ubuntu 20.04 'Focal Fossa'</b>, Ubuntu has introduced this new appstore called <i>Snapcraft</i> onto the world. The idea is 
 a good one, a simple app store for GNU/Linux distributions, where people using almost any distribution could easily find an application and install it. This would 
 make it much easier for developers to release their applications, as well, instead of having to release specific builds for specific distributions. Similar solutions  
 have been found in options like Flatpak and AppImage.</p>
<p style="color:black"><b>If you want to try out a GNU/Linux distro that <i>"just works"</i>, grab an Ubuntu image and install it on your machine and see how you like  
 it!</b></p>
<p style="color:black"><i>Please stay tuned to this page, as I plan to add some of my favorite software packages for GNU/Linux here that you should check out, and I 
 might eventually include some tutorials that could help people who are brand new to using GNU/Linux systems. I also intend to speak about Linux phones, such as the 
 Pinephone and the Librem 5, which I already have a <a href="https://fossphones.com">dedicated website</a> for if you want to learn more about it.</i></p>
