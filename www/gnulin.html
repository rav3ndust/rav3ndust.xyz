<p style="color:black"><b>GNU/Linux operating systems.</b></p>
<p style="color:black">For people who care about their technological freedom, privacy, and having complete control over their computing, there is no better operating system to choose
than a GNU/Linux distribution (except maybe BSD). When you choose to run a GNU/Linux distribution instead of one of the operating systems that hold power over their
users and force them to use non-free, closed-source software, you reclaim part of your digital freedom, and there is no better feeling than this.</p>
<p style="color:black">Of course, a big part of the appeal of free and open-source operating systems and software applications is the fact that we can take the source code, <i>change
it</i> if we'd like, and use it however we want to. We are then free to send our changes back to the maintainer of the project, and if they like the changes, the code
could become a permanent part of the project.</p>
<h3 style="color:black">Free software is great for community.</h3>
<p style="color:black">When you use free software, you know that there have been thousands of other eyes on the code, modifying it, and auditing its security. These same community members
make their own changes and contributions to software projects, and entire communities can form. Many huge projects have been formed from small and simple ideas. The
Linux kernel itself is a great example of the community that can form behind this ethos. Linus Torvalds wrote the Linux kernel, and then it was picked up and used in
projects ranging from the GNU operating system and Android, as well as powering the biggest majority of webservers in the world. If you are an internet user, you have
definitely interacted with a Linux server at some point, probably without even realizing it.</p>
<h3 style="color:black">What Linux distributions I like.</h3>
<p style="color:black">I am an unashamed distro-hopper, and am always messing around with different operating systems, usually in virtual machines these days. Here are my thoughts on 
some GNU/Linux distributions that I use frequently, and that I have used in the past.</p>

	<ul>
	<li><b>Linux Mint.</b> Linux Mint is still my go-to distro almost every time, so many years after getting into GNU/Linux so mamny years ago. Linux Mint is
	stable, it is friendly, and it is ready to get to work out of the box. You can find it in three official flavors for desktop environments, including Xfce,
	Cinnamon (Mint's homespun DE), and MATE. I am currently running Linux Mint 20 on my main workstation.</li>
	<li><b>Manjaro.</b> Manjaro is a great distribution that is based on Arch Linux, making it a rolling release. This means all of your packages will always 
	be up to date. Manjaro is also one of the best distributions for folks who want access to a functioning system immediately after install. Since this is 
	Arch-based, you also have access to the Arch User Repository (AUR), granting you access to thousands of extra packages you won't be able to find easily on
	some distros.</li>
	<li><b>Arch Linux.</b> I do love customizing, and there is no better playground for customization and tinkering than there is with Arch Linux. For a complete
	newbie, it can seem frustrating to install since you have to do everything yourself, but these days there are countless tutorials online and even scripts
	that you can run to help you set up a functioning Arch install in a matter of time. For learning all the ins and outs of Linux and really becoming a *power
	user*, you will find no better training than by learning and customizing Arch.</li>
	<li><b>Debian.</b> Debian is one of the oldest Linux distros out there, and is one of the options frequently used for servers. In fact, this very website
	is hosted by my Debian webserver. Debian is loved for being stable and rock solid, and this is one of the reasons why I frequently use Debian and some of
	its derivatives for my go-to work solutions.</li>
	</ul>

<h3 style="color:black">Notes on Ubuntu.</h3>
<p style="color:black">I used to <i>love</i> Ubuntu. In many ways, I still do. It was my introduction into the world of GNU/Linux back in 2012, after all. Unfortunately, it has been
getting harder and harder to recommend Ubuntu seriously to people. I feel like Canonical has been doing some things that are very against the user and more in the
interests of Canonical as a company rather than the community at large. I respect Canonical and how they bring desktop GNU/Linux to a huge audience, as Ubuntu is 
usually the entry point for newbies to the world of GNU/Linux when they come over from Windows or MacOS.</p>
<h4 style="color:black">The Snap debacle.</h4>
<p style="color:black">Recently, with <b>Ubuntu 20.04 'Focal Fossa'</b>, Ubuntu has forced this new 'app store' solution called <i>Snapcraft</i> onto the world. The idea is a good one,
 a simple app store for GNU/Linux distributions, where people using almost any distribution could easily find an application and install it. This would make it much 
easier for developers to release their applications, as well, instead of having to release specific builds for specific distributions (though there are easier ways
to do this thanks to solutions like Flatpak and AppImage).</p>
<p style="color:black">With Snap, Canonical instead decided that it had to work only through the Ubuntu Software Center, and replaced the popular <b>Chromium apt package</b> with an 
empty package instead, one that force-installed snap and the snap version of Chromium, instead of giving the user the version they asked for. This is sneaky, and 
makes it seem as though Canonical knows what the user wants more than the user themselves.</p>
<p style="color:black"><b>Thanks to tricks like these, I can no longer recommend Ubuntu in good faith. I still like the distribution as a whole, and I hope in the future Canonical sees
what a mess snap has become and realizes that user choice and freedom are more important than their own business interests.</b></p>
<p style="color:black"><i>Please stay tuned to this page, as I plan to add some of my favorite software packages for GNU/Linux here that you should check out, and I might eventually
include some tutorials that could help people who are brand new to using GNU/Linux systems. I also intend to speak about Linux phones, such as the Pinephone and the 
Librem 5, which I already have a <a href="https://fossphones.com">dedicated website</a> for if you want to learn more about it.</i></p>

        <h3>Check out some of the stuff I'm building!</h3>
        <p>I'm usually always writing <a href="software.html">some new software</a>. Lately, I've been working on a new webapp and some bash scripts. All my stuff
        is free and open-source on my GitHub, so feel free to <i>git clone</i> my stuff and try it out, modify it, and do whatever you'd like with it.</p>
        <p>If you like what I'm doing, think about <a href="contribute.html">helping me buy a pizza</a> so I'm nice and full enough to keep writing software.</p>
