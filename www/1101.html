<h2>My solar panel setup.</h2>
<p>Several months ago, I was lucky enough to be given my own solar panel setup, completely free! This unexpected gift came from someone who
is like family to me, my best friend's dad.</p>
<p>I've been planning on doing stuff with solar panels for a long time, and one of my main goals is to have my cryptocurrency miners setup
in a building with solar power, so that I am mining using renewable energy. This is still a project I am actively working on making come to 
fruition, so there are no photos or anything of this setup just yet.</p>
<p>I'm <i>hoping</i> to have all of this setup before 2021 is over, but with the last year being the way it has been, I don't have any 
guarantees. I <i>do</i> have plans to possibly build a small mining building with a friend of mine who has connections with construction, so 
something might actually come from that collaboration.</p>
<p>I am a huge proponent of solar energy, and it is one of the factors that plays into my goals of living off-grid. While we are setup on my 
land, we still have some work to do when it comes to establishing the more "off-grid" feel to the property. Slowly but surely, we are making 
progress on that front.</p>
<p>I hope to have some pictures taken of my solar panels soon when I have them set up. I still need to buy the wiring and a cell, but I have 
everything else for the project stored away in my shed and ready to go. Once I get everything with my little solar system squared away, I 
will make sure to take some pictures and post an updated blog entry here for anyone interested to check it out.</p>

	<h3>Check out some of the stuff I'm building!</h3>
	<p>I'm usually always writing <a href="software.html">some new software</a>. Lately, I've been working on a new webapp and some bash scripts. All my stuff
        is free and open-source on my GitHub, so feel free to <i>git clone</i> my stuff and try it out, modify it, and do whatever you'd like with it.</p>
        <p>If you like what I'm doing, think about <a href="contribute.html">helping me buy a pizza</a> so I'm nice and full enough to keep writing software.</p>
