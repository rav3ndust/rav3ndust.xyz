<h1>Some Random Stuff</h1>
<p>You can find some random tidbits of other things I've done that aren't software related or other things I generally find interesting that don't fit anywhere else on my website.</p>

<h3>My Music</h3>
<p>Here are some links to music that I've written and old musical projects I was a part of.</p>
<p>I don't actively write as much music anymore, but I might try to record some more stuff in the future.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://soundcloud.com/avalon69">Arkane</a> - My original solo musical project.</li>
    <li><a href="https://soundcloud.com/x3nyth">x3nyth</a> - My newer solo musical project.</li>
    <li><a href="https://soundcloud.com/symphonia0982">Symphonia</a> - an electronic musical group I was a part of. The project is no longer active.</li>
    </ul>
<!--insert other random stuff here when i think of it-->
<h3>I'm a big fan of this stuff.</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>The <a href="https://www.fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.acdc.com">AC/DC</a>, still my favorite band of all time. Their new album, PWRUP, is amazing.</li>
    <li>I have a growing obsession with buying a lot of hardware from <a href="https://www.pine64.org">Pine64</a>, a great company in the FOSS community.</li>
    <li>I strongly recommend using the <a href="https://lbry.tv">LBRY</a> platform for video content. It continues to grow with new, cool stuff all the time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Check out some of the stuff I'm building!</h3>
    <p>I'm usually always writing <a href="software.html">some new software</a>. Lately, I've been working on a new webapp and some bash scripts. All my stuff is free and open-source on my GitHub, so feel free to <i>git clone</i> my stuff and try it out, modify it, and do whatever you'd like with it.</p>
    <p size="28px">If you like what I'm doing, think about <a href="contribute.html">helping me buy a pizza</a> so I'm nice and full enough to keep writing software.</p>
