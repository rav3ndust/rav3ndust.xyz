<h1>September 20, 2020</h1>
<h2>Welcome to rav3n's blog</h2>
<p>If you're wondering what all of this is about, it is pretty much just going to be a place for me to talk about anything and everything. The biggest majority of the 
things I write about will probably be related to GNU/Linux and free software, but I will probably be writing about a lot more than just those things.</p>
<p>I will frequently have random things cross my mind, things that wouldn't fit if I were to talk about them on any of the other sites I own, which are very niched. I
 like the idea of being able to just put up whatever I'd like on my personal site, so we will see what happens with it. I have been building this site out in my 
 spare time and I am happy to finally see it officially live on my webserver. I'm not looking to make a lot of money (if any) off of this blog or even this site. I 
 mainly just wanted my own place that I could talk about whatever I wanted.</p>
<h3>2020 is the perfect year to talk about anything.</h3>
<p>For people who are looking for something to talk about, 2020 sure hasn't disappointed. I have spent the majority of the year messing about with my Pinephone and 
 other mobile related things, while also working on building out some websites. I also learned that there is a name for my type of lifestyle.</p>
<p><i>It's called quarantine.</i></p>
<p>Okay, not the funniest joke, but I thought it was amusing enough. This post is mainly just a way for me to have something living on my blog until I get my thoughts
 together for the next blog entry. I think I'm going to try to write something to put up on here every Sunday, but you can expect my days to get mixed up since I'm 
always working on something. If I miss posting on a Sunday, I will try to post as soon as I can the next day, though no promises since I am currently managing about 4
 websites, with a fifth in the works.</p>
<h3>Why have a personal site?</h3>
<p>A personal site is a fun playground to do whatever you want with. I pay about $5 a month for my webserver, and I write all of my webpages on my own. Having my own
 personal website means it is not tied to one of my businesses, and it can act as my playground to have some fun and mess around. I plan to host videos here, put up a
 search engine, and all kinds of other fun things that wouldn't make sense to do on my other sites.</p>
<p>Not only do I want this site to be fun for me, I want it to be fun for people who might stop by as well, so if you think about any cool ideas that I could use to 
 make this site even better, make sure you let me know so I can try to incorporate them.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's it for this time. I'll see you next time, when we will get more into free software related topics and then, who knows what else from there.</p>
<p><b>See you next time!</b></p>
