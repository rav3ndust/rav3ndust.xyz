        <p align="center" size="4px" style="background-color:grey"><i>your friendly neighborhood rav3n</i></p>
        <p><i><b>rav3ndust</b></i> is the assumed pseudonym of me, your webmaster. I'm a weirdo who has a love of a few different things, mostly technology related. I also love anything related to off-grid living and alternative, renewable energy sources. I'll be writing about my weird hobbies here online. Some of my many interests include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Linux and open-source software.</b> I love having the ability to download, use, modify, and contribute to free and open source software projects. I also love the privacy benefits I gain from using these options over closed, walled gardens like those offered by Microsoft Windows and Apple's Mac.</li>
                <li><b>Linux phones.</b> I am a <i>huge</i> proponent of devices like the PinePhone and the Librem 5. I hope these devices have huge success and show people that there are alternative sources to the big names in tech when it comes to defending your privacy on mobile phones. It is also why I started my <a href="http://fossphones.com">FOSSphones</a> website, to allow people to find the news on these devices and their related operating system projects easily.</li>
                <li><b>Off-grid living.</b> I live with my wife on my property way out in the woods, and I am always interested in learning more about off-grid living solutions, things like renewable energy sources like solar power, gardening, and more.</li>
                <li><b>Cryptocurrencies.</b> I am enamoured with the very idea of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and have done several mining and day trading projects on the side. Currently, I have a few crypto-related projects in the works that I will be happy to share in the future.</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Check out some of the stuff I'm building!</h3>
    <p>I'm usually always writing <a href="software.html">some new software</a>. Lately, I've been working on a new webapp and some bash scripts. All my stuff is free and open-source on my GitHub, so feel free to <i>git clone</i> my stuff and try it out, modify it, and do whatever you'd like with it.</p>
    <p size="28px">If you like what I'm doing, think about <a href="contribute.html">helping me buy a pizza</a> so I'm nice and full enough to keep writing software.</p>
