<h1>November 8, 2020</h1>
<h2>Why you should build your own website.</h2>
<p>What is so important about having your very own website? Why shouldn't you just have your online presence set up through a platform like 
Facebook, Twitter, or one of the other thousands of social platforms on the internet?</p>
<p><b><u>It's all about having control over your online life.</u></b></p>
<p>Making your own website is quite simple. You can have it up and running with less than a day's work if you play with it enough.</p>
<p>What is so important about running your own site? Why is it such a rewarding experience? Well, for one, it is the absolute <i>control</i> 
you get from running a site of your very own. When you have a site of your own that you can do whatever you want with, you don't have to 
worry about one of the big platforms censoring, deplatforming, or "cancelling" you for any reason whatsoever. If you have an opinion that
goes against the political norms, you can voice it as you'd like on your own site without worrying about upsetting someone on Zuckbook or
one of the similar platforms, where they might <b>report</b> your opinions and get you banned from the platform.</p>
<h3>Censorship sucks. But it isn't the only reason to want to host your own site.</h3>
<p>What other reason would you have to cut the cord from social media and rely on yourself for your existence online? Well, if you're into
web development and learning more about how the internet works, buying a domain, setting up a server, and learning how you run your own 
site really teaches you a lot about how the internet works. When you set up your own site on a webserver, you learn a <i>ton</i> not only
about how setting up a site of your own really works, but also teaches you some great lessons that you will never forget.</p>
<p>Once your site is up and running, you can play with it on your server anytime you'd like. You can post whatever you want, you can try
out any kind of web technologies on your site that you'd like, and more. It is so easy!</p>
<h3>But wait! I'm not a web developer! What do I do?</h3>
<p>No worries! You don't have to be a pro with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to have your own presence on the internet. You can use other, easier
solutions that allow you to build your site using nothing but drag and drop methods. One of the most well-known solutions for doing this is
<a href="https://wordpress.com">Wordpress</a>, which allows you to build your own site on your own domain and server, for free.</p>
<p>I would generally advise for you to keep your site on your <i>own</i> webserver where you are in full control. It might be a bit more of
a learning curve for a complete newbie, but it will be worth it when you aren't worrying about a platform like SquareSpace hosting all of your
content and potentially going down if something happens to the site.</p>
<p>The most important rule of thumb when it comes to running your own website is to <b><u>always host it on your own webserver</u></b>. You
don't want to have to worry about a centralized service where your site is hosted, like SquareSpace or Clickfunnels, to go down with you
having no backup of your site. <i>Always</i> keep backups of your site files and always have it self-hosted so you aren't reliant on 
anybody but yourself when it comes to making sure your site is online at all times.</p>
<h3>In short, running your own site contributes to your own online freedom.</h3>
<p>Since the advent of social media, the internet has become a lot more boring. Gone are the days of finding people's unique HTML sites about
UFOs and their favorite musicians. We have collectively decided that a few companies (Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc) are in control of 
how we socialize with each other online. When you have your own website and buck the dependence on social media, you make a statement that
you are not going to be one of the people controlled by social media. You are establishing your own presence on the internet, and not 
relying on someone else's server space to allow you to exist online.</p>
<h3>Want to get started building websites of your own?</h3>
<p>Here are some of the resources I use when it comes to running my own websites.</p>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="https://epik.com">Epik</a>, the domain registrar I use to buy my domain names.</li>
	<li><a href="https://vultr.com">Vultr</a>, the site where I spin up webservers to host my sites. This very site is hosted by my Vultr
	webserver running Debian.</li>
	</ul>
<p>That's all you need to get started! You can look into learning more about HTML and CSS if you want to learn how to build basic webpages
on your own, or you can go ahead and learn more about setting up WordPress on your new server to get your site up and running quickly.</p>
<p><i>It's all up to you!</i> Find a domain name you like, get a server up and running, and build your very own online presence. You don't 
have to continue to be dependent on the Big Tech platforms--you can use existing and available technologies to get yourself setup online
without having to worry about the permission of any web giants.</p>
