			<p>Sounds like my wife and I might be going out into town today to visit the haunted house in town. Sounds like it might be a good time, as long as it isn't as lame as some of the ones our school tries to come up with back in the day with cheap tricks and little smoke machines. :)</p>
			<p>Been playing some Celeste in between moving more things around in the repos. Everything is settled on the site, other than some dead links that need filled in where we have some missing spots in the wiki. All in good time!</p>
			<p>We watched <i>The Exorcist: Believer</i> the other night. It was about what I thought it was going to be. The story held up fine, but the "scares" just weren't scary, but it seems like not many modern horror flicks are anymore. Still, with that in mind, the source material is in a class of its own.</p>
			<p>If anyone else is reading this, hope you have a happy halloween.</p>

			<p>Happy Halloween! I finally got my new site redesign live on my server, and have had a busy last few months while slowly building it up. Keep in mind that if you're reading the site now, you might find that there are a few dead links - this is being worked on, so you don't need to worry about opening up an issue in the repo :)</p>
			<p>We have also been working on moving our fediverse instance, <a href="https://neighborli.xyz">neighborli</a>, over to mastodon. The transition is complete, and anyone who wants is welcome to join in the conversation - registration is open and ready!</p>
			<p>We're thinking about having dinner tonight after work and maybe hitting a haunted house in town. I don't look forward to the traffic, but I'm sure it will be a fun time.</p>

			<p><b>16:37</b></p>
			<p>Decided it was time to revamp my personal site. Been working on the <b>wiki</b> (aka digital garden), writing down some of the recipes we use around here to include on this site, and finishing up the redesign overall. It's looked the same for several years now, so thought it was time to switch it up.</p>
			<p>Other than that, been trying to beat the summer heat here in Arkansas (finally got some rain (and some crazy wind) lately thanks to the remnants of Beryl, which cooled it down a bit), working on our <b>Dark Nights Rising</b> game, doing some music, and getting back into building little raspberrypi-powered computers to use around here for homestead automation.</p>
			<blockquote>Fun fact - I adapted the stylesheet for the site revamp from my custom <a href="https://midnight.pub">Midnight Pub</a> theme! :-)</blockquote>
