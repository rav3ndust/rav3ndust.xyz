		<h2>my solar panel setup</h2>
		<p><i>slowly getting my renewable energy setup</i></p>
        <p><b style="color:#FF10F0">2020-11-01</b></p>
        <p>Several months ago, I was lucky enough to be given my own solar panel setup, completely free! This unexpected gift came from someone who is like family to me, my best friend's dad.</p>
        <p>I've been planning on doing stuff with solar panels for a long time, and one of my main goals is to have my cryptocurrency miners setup in a building with solar power, so that I am mining using renewable energy. This is still a project I am actively working on making come to fruition, so there are no photos or anything of this setup just yet.</p>
        <p>I'm hoping to have all of this setup before 2021 is over, but with the last year being the way it has been, I don't have any guarantees. I do have plans to possibly build a small mining building with a friend of mine who has connections with construction, so something might actually come from that collaboration.</p>
        <p>I am a huge proponent of solar energy, and it is one of the factors that plays into my goals of living off-grid. While we are setup on my land, we still have some work to do when it comes to establishing the more "off-grid" feel to the property. Slowly but surely, we are making progress on that front.</p>
        <p>I hope to have some pictures taken of my solar panels soon when I have them set up. I still need to buy the wiring and a cell, but I have everything else for the project stored away in my shed and ready to go. Once I get everything with my little solar system squared away, I will make sure to take some pictures and post an updated blog entry here for anyone interested to check it out.</p>
