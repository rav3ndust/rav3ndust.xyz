		<p><i>Making healthier adjustments.</i>
		<p><b style="color:#FF10F0">2024-05-08</b></p>
		<p>I've been a big soda drinker for a long time, and in a bid to work on getting healthier this year, I am preparing to bid it adieu. Since I was a teenager, I've had a huge thing for Pepsi and Dr. Pepper, and while I've always acknowledged that drinking sodas every day is not good for me (much like smoking tobacco), it is something I have continued to do for awhile, simply because it's what I've always done.</p>
		<p>This year, I have decided to quit drinking sodas entirely, and cut out most caffeine. Perhaps I will have a coffee every now and again, but I want to cut out soda completely, and reduce my reliance on caffeine in general. I plan to do the same thing with nicotine - but one thing at a time. :)</p>
		<h3 style="color:#FF10F0">how it's been going</h3>
		<p>While I have not completely cut out sodas entirely yet, I have massively reduced my intake. I have been having only one a day (in the morning). I'm used to having caffeine right when I wake up, so the first thing I do is grab a soda, and if I don't have any, I use the coffee pot (which I should be doing more of anyway instead of consuming sodas).</p>
		<p>I'm happy to report that I have only had one soda per day for the last month or so. For the most part, I have replaced them with water and tea. I have also really been enjoying Spindrift, a sparkling water that is made entirely with water, fruit juices, and no sugar. Those have been nice to reach for during times I probably would have otherwise reached for a soda.</p>
		<p>While I am not (according to my doctor) an unhealthy person, I want to maintain my health for as long as I can and cut out any risk factors that could increase the chance for things like diabetes and heart issues, things that run in my family. Cutting out sodas will be a massive net gain on that front with the amounts of sugar in sodas. I am getting ready to begin quitting smoking, as well, and I am looking forward to getting that habit kicked, too.</p>
		<p>I am also eating a lot healthier, as well. As someone who works online, I have a few unhealthy dietary habits (quick, cheap meals that are certainly no good for you, things like fast food). While my wife and I cook a lot of home-cooked, healthy meals, often using things right from our own garden, I want to cut out some of the more unhealthy things that still exist from time to time in my diet.</p>
		<p>This includes things like going out to those fast food restaurants, reducing intake of things like cheap frozen pizzas, and instead of snacking on horrible things like potato chips, make a habit out of healthier snacks, such as grapes or berries. I'm not going to say something I know isn't true, like that I'll never eat "junk food" again, but I want it to certainly be a rare occasion.</p>
		<p>As for other healthier things I'm trying to do, I'm also spending more time in exercise and meditation. I have a terrible back, so the types of exercises I can participate in can't get super strenuous, but I enjoy a nice, long walk around my property's trails when the weather is nice. I have also been trying to spend more time in meditation - just sitting among nature outside (or quietly in a room if the weather is meh) and aligning myself with my mind again. I would posit that anyone who spends as much time in front of a computer as I do could glean positive benefits from this practice.</p>
		<p>I haven't updated on here in awhile, but this is something I've been working on as a personal goal for myself, as well as with my wife, as we are both working to improve our health together this year. I know that at the end of the day, spending more time exercising, cutting out some of these bad habits like nicotine, caffeine, and some of the more unhealthy things I eat sometimes will be a net positive health-wise, and my body and mind will thank me.</p>
