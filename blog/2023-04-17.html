		<h2>the cynical trap</h2>
		<p><i>don't let 'em get you down</i>
		<p><b style="color:#FF10F0">2023-04-17</b></p>
		<p>Over the last few years (and understandably enough), there has been a fresh wave of cynicism online and irl. I have seen more people claiming to be depressed, suicidal, and the like over the last few years than at any other time in my life. Obviously, I knew depressed and suicidal people before, as well as the occasional outright pessimist who can never be positive about anything, but since covid-19 started, it's been one wave after another.</p>
		<p>I went through a period in my life several years ago when I lived in Oklahoma where I was the kind of person I am referring to now. I was a drunkard, and I was taking pills that I shouldn't have been taking. To make a long story short, I spent several years hanging out with the wrong people and making the wrong decisions. Later on, the very people I thought were close friends would move on to steal things from me, and I finally cut off all contact with them.</p>
		<p>I quit all the stupid things I was doing. I kicked my pill habit, and I cut way down on drinking. I still have the occasional beer or whiskey, but it's once every few months compared to seeking a buzz every single day.</p>
		<p>During those years, I can't imagine I was too much fun to be around. I found negativity in everything. You could have shown me a picture of a beautiful blue sky, and I could point out the one small cloud off in the distance. You could show me a picture of a cute puppy, and I'd tell you that eventually that cute puppy is going to grow old and die. I probably took the joy out of most conversations.</p>
		<h3 style="color:#FF10F0">finding happiness in a world full of hostility</h3>
		<p>It can be hard to find joy when all around you are people constantly talking about dark and depressing stuff. Sure, there are bad things always happening in the world, but there are plenty of good things happening, as well. You just won't hear about them as often, because positive stories don't drive as much clicks and engagement as stories about bad things do.</p>
		<p>Quitting doing the unhealthy habits wasn't the only thing I began doing to get myself thinking more positively again. I started doing a number of things that greatly helped me, and continue to help me to this day when it comes to keeping my mind free of the perpetual negativity that seems to cloud so many folks' heads these today:</p>
		<ul>
            <li><b>Don't live on social media!</b> - This is one of the biggest things that seem to drive constant negativity in people. Social media is designed to keep you hooked to it, always scrolling and always refreshing to get the latest dopamine hits that keep you coming back for more. Twitter is one of the worst -  constant arguments and trolls tearing each other down just because they know they can. Facebook is rife for people sharing conspiracies, Instagram is great for depressing teenage girls and making them feel as though they'll never be pretty enough, and TikTok is...well, full of crazy shit from all sides of the spectrum.</li>
			<li><b>Don't watch the mainstream news media!</b> - The mainstream news media is one of the worst offenders, right behind social media, when it comes to constantly keeping people divided and angry. They constantly air stories pitting Democrat against Republican, constant stories full of violence and derision. When was the last time you saw a positive, heartwarming story on the mainstream news media? I can't tell you the last time I did - but then again, I haven't watched it in years. Find independent, credible news sources you can keep up with to stay up-to-date with the latest happenings.</li>
			<li><b>Search for positive stories!</b> - Like I mentioned earlier, you're rarely going to find positive stories like people helping other people on social media or from the mainstream news media. These kinds of stories don't get as much attention, likes, traffic, and engagement, so they aren't pushed like all the negative stories are. I recommend checking out places like the <a href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/">Good News Network</a> every now and again - they go out of their way to push positive, helpful stories.</li>
			<li><b>Don't get caught up!</b> - I don't know about you, but I'm almost a terminally online person. I work online, and when I'm done working, I usually get my playing (either gaming or watching YouTube) online as well. It can be easy to get caught up in the <i>Current Online Thing</i> - there are always some stupid arguments going on online, either someone is offended about something someone else said, or  caught up in some kind of <b>X-ism</b> (racism, sexism, etc). Sure, there are issues in our world, and they need addressing. No one's denying that. However, change isn't effected by sitting around, complaining and flaming each other online. It's made by smart political organization, protesting, and voting for the candidates who represent your ideal principles.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We live in an increasingly online and connected world, and it is easier now than ever before to participate in discourse with people from all over the world about a number of issues. It is important to find balance, however - the internet (and the world as a whole) is filled with negative people who have their own issues to sort through. You can choose to make a more positive change for yourself, though. Try to surround yourself with those who make you at ease, who you feel comfortable around, and who encourage and lift you up instead of constantly dragging you into the mud with them.</p>
        <p>Also, there's power in stepping away from the screens every now and then - what's the phrase?</p>
