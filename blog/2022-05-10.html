		<h2>vim over VScode? ok, boomer!</h2>
		<p><i>text editors are just text editors</i></p>
		<p><b style="color:#FF10F0">2022-05-10</b></p>
        <p>While the title might be a bit of a joke, since Vi (the original editor that spawned Vim) is at this point, over 30 years old, there is some truth in that statement above. I wonder how many young coders, fresh out of their bootcamps, knowing nothing but VScode (which is a wonderful editor), IntelliJ, and other GUI editors that I've probably never heard of or used, likewise also probably know nothing about Vim (or worse still, put off by its terminal-centric nature or "overwhelming" way of going about things?).</p>
		<p>I grew up around computers my whole life thanks to my dad, and always had a sort of fascination with what made them "tick." I can remember getting excited about my first Visual BASIC program - a short program that printed curse words on the screen. It was juvenile and tasteless, but it was my first program - and it was enough to create an obsession for programming which continues to this very day, as I approach 30 years of age myself - like my old friend, Vim.</p>
		<p>Over the years, the more I got into GNU/Linux and different programming languages more seriously as I fell deeper into the rabbit hole, the more I got used to and comfortable with Vim.</p>
		<h3 style="color:#FF10F0">They Tell Me the Grass is Greener</h3>
		<p>I have been using <i>almost nothing but Vim</i> for what seems like eons now. I have my own configuration file, which has been the same for a long time - I might make little tweaks to it here and there every now and again, but for the most part, my vimrc hasn't changed in quite awhile, and if it <i>does</i> change, it's because I did it.</p>
		<p>While VScode and other big-name editors are nice, they go through changes quite often as new functionalities are added. This is the reason these editors are *huge* (I'm looking specifically at VScode and Atom, which are Electron apps) - I'd rather not have to open a minified Chromium instance just to edit code, when Vim is already right here on my system and waiting for me.</p>
		<blockquote style="color:red">In fact, my Vim instance is pre-configured...my Debian and Arch installation scripts pull it from my repositories and applies it for me on any new Debian or Arch installation, so I don't even have to think about it!</blockquote>
		<h3 style="color:#FF10F0">Keyboard Shortcuts Committed to Memory</h3>
		<p>While you might scoff when you're first thinking of typing <code>:q!</code> to exit a file, Vim is more powerful than any other editor that I'm aware of specifically because of one reason: <b>Powerful keyboard shortcuts</b>.</p>
		<p>While it could be the fact that I have used so many of these shortcuts that they have become muscle memory over the years, it is also true that when working in Vim, I can be productive as I edit my code, not worrying about what new bells and whistles might have been added in the latest update of my huge text editor.</p>
		<blockquote style="color:red">In VScode, I have to install an extension to get my Vim keybindings. In Vim, they're already here! /s</blockquote>
		<h3 style="color:#FF10F0">Something Else to Learn</h3>
		<p>There are new editors coming out all the time, and I don't want to have to play with all of them. Call me stubborn, but Vim has never failed me, and I see no reason to think that it should anytime soon. Plus, with my Vim configs, I am always setup and ready to go on any machine with Vim on it - which is most GNU/Linux distributions, which tend to come with Vim right out of the box.</p>
		<p>Don't get me wrong, I do like VScode, and I have used it and enjoyed a ton of its very useful features. But at the end of the day, when it really comes time to get into writing some code, or even writing a simple markdown document (as I'm doing right now), I'm going to be reaching for Vim every single time.</p>
