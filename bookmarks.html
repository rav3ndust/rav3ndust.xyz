		<p>They are not sorted in any particular order - sometimes I add several things to this list in a week, and sometimes I don't update it for ages. However, I've found a lot of great sites out there on the web, and I want to list them all here to share them with others - it doesn't seem very fair to hoard them all away in my firefox bookmark manager.</p>
		<p>Also, since I have a lot of bookmarks from different online protocols, I'm going to categorize them for easy sort-ability. You'll find everything sorted into <code>http://</code>, <code>gemini://</code> and <code>.onion</code> categories with their respective links.</p>
